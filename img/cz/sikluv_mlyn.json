    "location_long_descr": "The heart of the Šiklův mlýn area is a western town located in the valley of the Bobrůvka river. The town is continuously expanded and renovated in order to satisfy the demands of even the most demanding visitor. Even so, the atmosphere from years long ago, from the days of the settlement of the Wild West, still breathes on you.<br>The area is intended for active people who like fun, adrenaline, but also occasionally look for a place to rest and relax. Šiklův mlýn is an ideal place for a one-day or two-day trip , but you can also enjoy a wonderful vacation here, and we also offer original camps or school trips. Families with children like us the most and the area is popular , but stays for seniors or groups of friends are also offered here.",
