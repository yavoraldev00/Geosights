    "location_long_descr": "The interior of the Butterfly House mimics the jungle in the area of Cambodia's famous Angkor Wat temple, and the conditions in which the butterflies live there are similar: the operators keep the temperature at 30°C and the relative humidity at 80 percent.<br>The butterflies here come basically from all over the world, but their homeland is always in the forest. The plan is to have approximately 600 butterflies from 40 countries around the world at all times . Since it is open year-round, the species will also change, so there will be different butterflies in the spring than in the fall. In addition to the 'regular' butterflies, there will also be butterflies with a wingspan of around 20 centimeters , and sometimes real specialties, such as the Attacus atlas, the world's largest butterfly, are to be shown at special events.",
